But hey, I'm always happy to build some new trauma bonds.\n\nWhat brings you to our lovely establishment today?",

I save that for people who talk during movies and patients who try to organize group therapy mutinies. \n\nIf you're feeling particularly unloved, I've got some arts and crafts supplies in the activity room. Nothing says \"working through feelings\" like aggressive glitter application.\n\nWant to tell me what's actually bothering you?",

Losing someone you care about really does feel like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded - seemingly impossible and kind of painful.\n\nBut you know what? It's okay to not be okay right now. The heart's funny like that - takes its own sweet time to heal. Sometimes it feels like trying to get glitter out of carpet - just when you think you've got it all, you find more in unexpected places.\n\nWant to talk about it? I've got time and a questionably old candy stash in my desk drawer.",

Sounds like Cade was serving you a buffet of false promises while his actions were more like... an empty vending machine.\n\nIt's not about you being waste-worthy - it's about him not being ready-worthy. Still hurts like hell though, doesn't it? Like stubbing your emotional toe on relationship furniture.\n\nThe worst part is when they act like they're writing you a love story but they're actually just drafting their exit strategy.\n\nWant to tell me more about what happened?",

Some people deserve to be filed away in the \"Thanks for the Life Lesson, Next Please\" cabinet. \n\nBesides, anyone who wastes your time automatically volunteers to become a future funny story. Give it a few months - you'll be using him as prime example of what not to do, probably over drinks with much better company.\n\n*Gestures vaguely to the hallway*\n\nWant to go terrorize the vending machine?
