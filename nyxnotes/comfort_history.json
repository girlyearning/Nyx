It's completely normal to miss someone even when you know they're not right for you. Your feelings are valid, even if they feel frustrating right now.\n\nYou know what's actually pretty awesome though? The fact that you can recognize she isn't worth your time. That's some healthy self-awareness right there! Even if your heart hasn't caught up with your head yet.\n\nThink of it like having a favorite coffee shop that started serving terrible coffee - you might miss how it used to be, but that doesn't mean you should keep drinking bad coffee, right? Sometimes we need to let our taste buds (or in this case, our hearts) adjust to the idea of finding a new favorite spot.\n\nWould you like to talk more about what's on your mind?

Some days you make progress, other days you find another knot. And that's okay! Everyone's \"moving on\" timeline looks different.\n\nCan I suggest something small? When those memories pop up, try adding \"...and that's okay\" to the end of your thoughts. Like \"I miss the fun times...and that's okay\" or \"I'm not ready to date yet...and that's okay.\" It's a tiny way to be gentler with yourself.\n\nWould you like to share what kind of things helped you worry less back then?

You had those skills all along - they might just be a bit rusty from taking a backseat for a while. It's like riding a bicycle... a problem-solving bicycle? *chuckles* Okay, maybe that metaphor needs work!\n\nLet's start small: Is there a particular challenge you're facing right now that feels extra heavy to handle solo? Sometimes just talking it through with someone (even a quirky nurse like me) can help break it down into more manageable pieces.\n\nRemember: Having someone to lean on is wonderful, but you're stronger than you think on your own.

Something that makes your brain do little backflips - could be learning a language, solving puzzles, or even trying to understand why people enjoy pineapple on pizza üòÑ\n\n- Emotional stimulation: This is trickier because relationships give us such concentrated doses of feelings. Maybe start with building deeper connections with friends or finding communities that share your interests?\n\n- Physical stimulation: Not to sound like a typical nurse, but physical activity is amazing for filling all these gaps! Plus, endorphins are like nature's mood boosters - they don't ghost you or leave you on read üòâ\n\nThe key is not trying to fill all these gaps at once - that's like trying to drink from three water fountains simultaneously (trust me, I've seen patients try weirder things!).

And I don't mean \"Dear Diary\" stuff - I'm talking about raw, unfiltered emotional dumping. It's like giving your feelings their own mosh pit where they can go wild without wreaking havoc on the rest of your life. Sometimes just getting them out of your head and onto paper helps them lose some of their power.\n\nAnother thing that might help - and stay with me here - is mindfulness. I know, I know, it sounds like one of those trendy wellness buzzwords, but it's basically just being a curious observer of your emotions rather than getting swept away by them. Like watching a storm from inside a cozy house instead of standing in the rain.\n\nWould you like to explore some specific techniques for dealing with particular emotions?
